# Diabetes Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based diabetes prediction system developed using Python and Support Vector Machine (SVM).  
The model predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical attributes.

This project was implemented using Google Colab as part of a student mini-project.
